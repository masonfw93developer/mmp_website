            <h3 class="welcome-message"> Welcome to the Mind and Moral Psychology Working Group! </h3>

            <br>

            <p class="background-info">The Mind and Moral Psychology Working Group (MMP) is an interdisciplinary
              group coordinated by Philosophy graduate students at the University of
              Michigan. MMP meets throughout the academic year to discuss and workshop
              papers relevant to issues in philosophy of mind, moral psychology,
              and the cognitive sciences.</p>

            <br>

            <p class="info-2021">Events for the 2020-2021 academic year will include an invited
              discussant series, and a number of graduate student work-in-progress
              sessions. Due to COVID-19, all our meetings will be virtual.</p>
